Lighthouse
	We need a cloud based list
		GitHub watchlist
	We need a locally owned list
		Something like Pihole and cloudflared
		These dont need to be watched, but need to be managed
	How can we get lighthouse to 


Need to implement
	Master Path
Lighthouse 
	Starts
	Checks if Cove is available, if not tries to start it
		If it cannot start cove, it waits until cove is available
	Then it will start all other containers it already has
		Start them if it finds any
	Start Watch loop for new updates
	Start CLI
	

Need to update
	container update
	Download new container
	rename? current container?
