# LightHouse

Lighthouse is a self-hosted CI/CD tool designed for developers who want automated deployment pipelines without the complexity or overhead of enterprise-grade systems. It watches your GitHub repositories for new commits, pulls the changes, builds your code, and deploys it to your local environment â€” all without needing external services.

Ideal for homelab enthusiasts, solo developers, or internal tools where speed and control matter.
